SteGoC2 is a detection tool built to find C2 traffic embedded into social media images with steganography. The project is built with Go.

We should be able to input a url to a social media post and analyze it for any embedded data that shouldnt be there.
The program should tell us what data was found and verify if it is or isnt C2 traffic. The program will be able to display plaintext C2 commands.
